# The-Movie-Database
This project analyzes a movies database (added with the files) and cleaning it. I then proposed some questions to answer them with the data found in the file,
these questions were:
1. How many movies of each genre had been produced since 1966?
2. What is the relation between the budget used to produce a film, the revenue gained from the movie, and the popularity of the movie?
3. I suspect that movies with more runtime would require more budget to sustain, I delved deeper to check if that was true.
4. I wanted to check if the average score of a film is related to its revenue, I suspect they are related.

I visualized scatter plots and line plots to find out the answers to these questions as found in the file. 
Movie Database project.ipynb is the report with the code in it. 
Movie Database project.html is the same report in html format for easier access. 
tmdb-movies.csv is the csv file with the raw data.
